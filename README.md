#Genesis Starter Reloaded

This is my starter theme for creating custom websites using the Genesis Framework.

It is designed as a starting point, and is deliberately light on styling, typography and layout.

Once cloned, you should run `bower install && npm install`.

From there, run `gulp`, and work within the build folder.
